        <p>A Russian airstrike on Odesa on Dec. 12 damaged infrastructure and left parts of the city without electricity and water, head of the Odesa Military Administration, Serhiy Lysak, reported.</p>

        <p>"Odesa has suffered another hostile attack," Lysak said on Telegram, adding that information about potential casualties was still being verified.</p>

        <p>He added that a residential building was also damaged during the attack. Emergency and utility services have been deployed to the site and are working to assess and repair the damage.</p>

        <p>On Dec. 13, residents reportedly received notifications that electricity supply is expected to be restored by Dec. 16. Meanwhile, technical water is being delivered to residents left without running water.</p>

        <p>On Dec. 13, four people suffered injuries following Russian strikes in Odesa Oblast. Governor Oleh Kiper described the overnight attack as “one of the largest” since the war began. Russia has targeted civilian energy and utility systems across Ukraine as part of its broader campaign against critical infrastructure.</p>

            <p>Terrible news… My thoughts are with all the residents of Odesa affected by this. I hope essential infrastructure, electricity, and water are restored as soon as possible.</p>
